# Problem Statement:

In this case study, the objective is to build an end-to-end scoring mechanism for Home Credit, a financial institution, to assist in the decision-making process for loan applications. The goal is to predict whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on the applicant's past behavior and application information.
Home Credit provides two datasets: application data and bureau data. The application data includes various attributes about the applicant, such as income, credit amount, family status, and education level. The bureau data contains detailed trade-level information about the applicant's credit history with other financial institutions.
The applicants with microloans, loans for working capital replenishment, and loans for the purchase of equipment are most likely to face repayment difficulties. Moderate repayment issues are seen with 'Another type of loan,' 'Consumer credit,' and 'Cash loan (non-earmarked).
